# hangman_game
Hangman_game using python functions and loop

# Project Prerequisites
This project requires functions and managing for/while loops. The functions that we use here contain arguments that are defined in a global scope which can be further used in other functions to improve game quality.
It can also be used to provide different steps when required to execute upon conditions by the for and while loops.
